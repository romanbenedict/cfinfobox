Displays a sidebar widget on pages or posts which displays all custom fields data associated with that post.

== Description ==

This plugin will enable you to put a sidebar widget on your blog to display all custom fields assicated with that page. Use it to display structured information about your post (contact numbers, facts, data etc). See installation instructions on how to configure the widget to display on certain sections of your site. 

You can also use the shortcode [infobox] which will display the information anywhere in the post as formatted text. 

Uses the the_meta() function of wordpress to display values. 

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

Once installed you will find the widget in the widget area of wordpress. Add it to a sidebar and the configuration options will become available. You will need to select a post type and a parent page/category (by ID only at the moment I\'m afraid) to display the meta information on. 
== Screenshots ==
1. The front end display of the widget in the default TwentyEleven Theme. 

2. The admin panel of the widget.
